    <p>
        Pav Bhaji is a popular street food dish from India, particularly associated with the state of Maharashtra and
        Mumbai in particular. It consists of a spicy mixture of mashed vegetables, typically including potatoes,
        tomatoes, peas, onions, and peppers, cooked with a blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and red
        chili powder. This mixture is served hot with buttered bread rolls known as pav.</p>
    <p>The dish is usually prepared on a flat griddle and the vegetables are mashed together with a special pav bhaji
        masala, giving it a rich and flavorful taste. It's often garnished with chopped onions, cilantro, and a squeeze
        of lime juice for added freshness. Pav Bhaji is loved for its savory and spicy flavor profile and is enjoyed as
        a snack or a meal by people of all ages across India.</p>
